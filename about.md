I believe in agile software development to build valuable software, and also in the collaborative work between the team for a better development environment.

* More than 10 years of experience in software development, using C#, ASP.NET, MVC, ORM, Ruby, Rails, Elixir, Phoenix, and Domain Driven Design concepts;

* SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL;

* I also advocate the use of agile methodologies for development. I am familiar with Scrum, Kanban, and Lean;
